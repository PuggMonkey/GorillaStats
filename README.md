## Overview
**GorillaStats** is a mod for *Gorilla Tag* that allows players to track and store important data during scrims. With an intuitive GUI, users can start and stop rounds while keeping track of critical gameplay stats such as *Tags* and *runtime*. After scrims, all of the data is saved into a JSON file for easy reference.

This mod is a valuable tool for competitive *Gorilla Tag* players who want to improve their strategies by reviewing in-game statistics.
